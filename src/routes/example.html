<h1>hello, world!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the world of server-side rendering using Squeeze.</p>
<p>
	Squeeze works by generating a route from html files in the
	<code>routes</code> directory. This particular route is named
	<code>example</code> and was generated from
	<code>/routes/example.html</code>. The html within each route is compressed
	before HTMX retrieves it.
</p>
<p>
	You can create your own route by adding a your-route-name.html file in the
	routes directory. Remember that the HTML head and body elements are already
	present in the server index, so you can just add the content you wish to
	render as if it were a component.
</p>
<p>
	<code>
		div id="content" hx-post="/example" hx-trigger="load"
		hx-target="#content"
	</code>
</p>
<p>
	You can alternatively modify this file by editing
	<code>/routes/example.html</code>
</p>
<p>CSS and images are placed in the <code>/static</code> directory.</p>
